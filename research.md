<p style="font-size:13px;font-family: Times New Roman"><u>Abstract</u>: <em>In this paper, we exploit the massive amount of information from Facebook to build a measure of gender attitudes in Italy at previously impossible resolution&#8210;the municipal level. We construct our index via a machine learning method to replicate a benchmark region-level measure. Interestingly, we find that most of the variation in our Gender Norms Index (GNI) is across towns within narrowly defined geographical areas, rather than across regions or provinces. In a second step, we show how this local variation in norms can be leveraged for identification purposes. In particular, we use our index to investigate whether these differences in norms carry over to the policy activity of politicians elected in the Italian Parliament. We document that females are more likely to sit in parliamentary committees focused on gender-sensitive matters, labor and social issues, but not if they come from a relatively conservative town. These effects are robust to conditioning on the legislative term and electoral district, suggesting the importance of social norms in shaping legislators' policy activity.</em></p>

<p style="font-size:13px;font-family: Times New Roman"><u>Abstract</u>: <em>Do gender norms affect the impact of parental leave policies? I show how, in presence of conservative norms, leave policies may fail to foster gender convergence, and possibly be counterproductive for it. I consider a model where mothers' career and couples' childcare decisions are affected by endogenous norms regarding maternal care. Adhering to conservative gender norms, mothers caring for their infants impose a negative externality on other mothers. The introduction of parental leave expands the utility-possibility frontier, and more mothers pursue high-level careers. However, both because of conservative norms and the reduced opportunity cost of care, they take inefficiently long leaves, thus reinforcing conservative gender roles. I show that fathers' quotas that reserve a fraction of the leave for fathers can restore efficiency. Intuitively, when parents share leave, mothers take shorter leaves, thus reducing norm costs suffered by other mothers. Hence, in gender conservative contexts, policies aiming to increase fathers' involvement in care are desirable not only for gender equity, but also on efficiency grounds. In a second step, I test my model's key predictions in the Italian context. I confirm that when they share leave with fathers, mothers take shorter leaves. Furthermore, mothers' education significantly decreases their likelihood of taking long leaves in areas with more neutral norms, but not in more traditional ones, confirming the importance of norms in leave uptake.</em></p>

<p style="font-size:13px;font-family: Times New Roman"><u>Abstract</u>: <em>In this paper, we empirically examine the role of gender culture in parental leave decisions. To this end, we leverage our Gender Norms Index (GNI) measuring municipal-level gender attitudes in Italy based on data from Facebook. Intuitively, our methodology generates variation in attitudes within narrowly defined geographical areas, thus allowing to compare individuals facing the same institutional and
labor market environments. Additionally, rich administrative data would enable to control for several worker and firm characteristics that affect individual participation to leave programs. We expect to find that living in more gender conservative areas induces female (male) workers to ask for relatively longer (shorter) leaves. We then ask whether such an effect is stronger for women at the top of the wage distribution, since taking a greater share of leave might help them alleviate their sense of &#8216;guilt&#8217; for having a career. Because the loss of work experience is particularly costly for them, long periods of leave may ultimately lead to large career costs. As a result, rather than facilitating gender convergence in the labor market, standard leave entitlements might in fact backfire, when interacting with slow-moving gendered culture.</em></p>

<p style="font-size:13px;font-family: Times New Roman"><u>Abstract</u>: <em>Recent research shows that well-targeted early-childhood interventions and childcare
provision yield very large returns. However, implementing these policies on a larger scale can be substantially costly, making it unclear whether the same benefits can be achieved. In this paper, we examine the welfare effect of an ambitious Canadian childcare reform that introduced universal daycare subsidies in Québec in 1997. Using novel data on regional daycare coverage rates within Québec, we revisit the current evidence on this reform. Our findings suggest that the expansion of local childcare capacity is an important channel of positive impact on child care use and maternal labor supply. In our social welfare analysis, we then incorporate fiscal returns from long-term policy impacts on children's earnings. Our results indicate that the negative short-term impacts on children did not translate
into negative economic outcomes later in life. Taking into account the impacts on both parents and children rather increases the social desirability of the reform. Focusing solely on labor-market responses of parents would thus underestimate the gains. We then compare a benchmark (sufficient-statistics) estimator, which assumes that the policy change is infinitesimal, to a structural approach, which can account for the fact that the reform is nonmarginal. This comparison allows us to quantify the extent of bias practitioners might be facing when applying sufficient-statistics methods to large policy changes. Our parsimonious model incorporates key trade-offs families face and for which affordable daycare options may provide substantial relief. We illustrate that the sufficient-statistics approach leads to
two biases, stemming from the omission of non-pecuniary benefits and re-optimization of behavior by recipients.</em></p>
