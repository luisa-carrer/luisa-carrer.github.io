### _The Effectiveness of Parental Leaves when Social Norms Matter_

<h1 style="font-size:16px;"><em>The Effectiveness of Parental Leaves when Social Norms Matter</em></h1>

---

<p style="font-size:8px;"><em>Do gender norms affect the impact of parental leave policies? I show how, in presence of conservative norms, leave policies may fail to foster gender convergence, and possibly be counterproductive for it. I consider a model where mothers' career and couples' childcare decisions are affected by endogenous norms regarding maternal care. Adhering to conservative gender norms, mothers caring for their infants impose a negative externality on other mothers. The introduction of parental leave expands the utility-possibility frontier, and more mothers pursue high-level careers. However, both because of conservative norms and the reduced opportunity cost of care, they take inefficiently long leaves, thus reinforcing conservative gender roles. I show that fathers' quotas that reserve a fraction of the leave for fathers can restore efficiency. Intuitively, when parents share leave, mothers take shorter leaves, thus reducing norm costs suffered by other mothers. Hence, in gender conservative contexts, policies aiming to increase fathers' involvement in care are desirable not only for gender equity, but also on efficiency grounds. In a second step, I test my model's key predictions in the Italian context. I confirm that when they share leave with fathers, mothers take shorter leaves. Furthermore, mothers' education significantly decreases their likelihood of taking long leaves in areas with more neutral norms, but not in more traditional ones, confirming the importance of norms in leave uptake.</em></p>

### _Gender Culture and Parental Leave: Evidence from Municipal-Level Facebook Data_

joint with Lorenzo de Masi (Universidad Carlos III)
---
_In this paper, we exploit the massive amount of information from Facebook to build a measure of gender attitudes at previously impossible resolution-the municipal level. After constructing our index via a machine learning method to replicate a benchmark region-level measure, we use it to empirically examine the role of gender culture in parental leave decisions. Our methodology generates variation in attitudes within narrowly defined geographical areas, thus allowing us to compare individuals facing the same institutional and labor market environments. Additionally, rich administrative data allows us to control for several worker and firm characteristics that likely affect the individual participation to leave programs. We expect to find that living in more gender conservative areas induces female (male) workers to ask for relatively longer (shorter) leaves. We then %study the heterogeneity of our estimates across different job occupations and wage levels. In particular, we ask whether such an effect is stronger for women at the top of the wage distribution, since taking a greater share of the leave might help them alleviate their sense of 'guilt' for having a career. Because the loss of work experience is particularly costly for them, long periods of leave may ultimately result in large career costs. As a result, rather than facilitating gender convergence in the labor market, standard leave entitlements might in fact backfire, when interacting with slow-moving gendered culture._

### _A Welfare Analysis of Family Policy: Lessons From a Large Childcare Reform in Canada_

_While numerous studies examine the causal impacts of changes in family policy, their overall welfare impacts for the economy at large are still poorly understood. 
In this paper, we wish to study the welfare effect of the most ambitious childcare reform in North America, which introduced universal daycare subsidies in Québec in 1997. To this end, we combine reduced-form and structural approaches to estimate the welfare impact of the policy with minimal structure. 
First, we will estimate the program's net cost for the government budget by leveraging evidence on the positive short- and long-term effects on maternal labor supply and children's education and labor market outcomes. Our preliminary results point to positive and large impacts on educational attainment of treated children as well as on labor-market outcomes of female children as they age. Using novel data on regional availability of daycare centers within Québec, we will also investigate treatment effect heterogeneity along this margin. Second, we will measure the program's value for recipients by estimating a structural model of household labor supply and child care arrangements for which we use the reduced-form evidence for validation. This allows us to both leverage the gains of the "credibility revolution" for the goal of welfare analysis, in the spirit of a sufficient statistics approach, and account for (possibly non-pecuniary) benefits for recipients, stemming from such a large policy change._
