<p style="font-size:14px;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; margin-top: 0.8em"><u>Abstract</u>: We study the implications of traditional gender norms for legislators' engagement with women's issues. We exploit information on the popularity of gender-related interests available from Facebook to capture variation in gender attitudes at the municipal level within Italy, a geographical resolution that would otherwise be unavailable. We then develop a granular Gender Norms Index (<em>GNI</em>) by replicating a region-level survey-based benchmark measure via machine learning algorithms. After validating our index by showing that it reflects other cultural and socio-economic variables, we leverage this local variation in norms to isolate their impact on legislators' policy activity in the Italian Parliament. We show that while female legislators are in general more likely to sponsor gender-related bills than men, the engagement is substantially smaller if they were born in more gender-conservative towns. The results are unlikely to be fully explained by party and constituency influences. These findings highlight the importance of social norms and sexist culture in lawmaking, possibly slowing down reform for the expansion of women's rights.

<p style="font-size:14px;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; margin-top: 0.8em"><u>Abstract</u>: Do gender norms affect the impact of parental leave policies? I show how, in presence of conservative norms, leave policies may fail to foster gender convergence, and possibly be counterproductive for it. I consider a model where mothers' career and couples' childcare decisions are affected by endogenous norms regarding maternal care. Adhering to conservative gender norms, mothers caring for their infants impose a negative externality on other mothers. The introduction of parental leave expands the utility-possibility frontier, and more mothers pursue high-level careers. However, both because of conservative norms and the reduced opportunity cost of care, they take inefficiently long leaves, thus reinforcing conservative gender roles. I show that fathers' quotas that reserve a fraction of the leave for fathers can restore efficiency. Intuitively, when parents share leave, mothers take shorter leaves, thus reducing norm costs suffered by other mothers. Hence, in gender conservative contexts, policies aiming to increase fathers' involvement in care are desirable not only for gender equity, but also on efficiency grounds. In a second step, I test my model's key predictions in the Italian context. I confirm that when they share leave with fathers, mothers take shorter leaves. Furthermore, mothers' education significantly decreases their likelihood of taking long leaves in areas with more neutral norms, but not in more traditional ones, confirming the importance of norms in leave uptake.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; margin-top: 0.8em"><u>Abstract</u>: In this paper, we empirically examine the role of gender norms in parental leave decisions. To this end, we leverage our Gender Norms Index (<em>GNI</em>) measuring municipal-level gender attitudes in Italy based on data from Facebook. Intuitively, our methodology generates variation in attitudes within narrowly defined geographical areas, thus allowing to compare individuals facing the same institutional and labor market environments. Additionally, rich administrative data enable to control for several worker and firm characteristics that affect individual participation to leave programs. We expect to find that living in more gender conservative areas induces female (male) workers to ask for relatively longer (shorter) leaves. We then ask whether such an effect is stronger for women at the top of the wage distribution, since taking a greater share of leave might help them alleviate their sense of &#8216;guilt&#8217; for having a career. Because the loss of work experience is particularly costly for them, long periods of leave may ultimately lead to large career costs. As a result, rather than facilitating gender convergence in the labor market, standard leave entitlements might in fact backfire, when interacting with slow-moving gendered norms.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; margin-top: 0.8em"><u>Abstract</u>: Recent research shows that targeted early-childhood interventions can yield large returns. However, implementing these policies on a larger scale can be considerably costly, making it unclear whether the same benefits can be achieved. In this paper, we evaluate the welfare effect of universal childcare provision. Leveraging variation from the 1997 &#8216;&#8216;$5 per day&#8217;&#8217; policy in Québec, we propose a method to empirically quantify the bias of sufficient-statistic estimators when applied to non-marginal reforms. The framework compares a benchmark reduced-form approach to a structural estimator accounting for the fact that the policy change is non-marginal. Using novel data on regional daycare coverage rates within Québec, our reduced-form analysis reveals that the increase in childcare availability, and not only the price decrease, is responsible for the positive impact of the reform on childcare use and maternal labor supply. Our behavioral model directly incorporates the shortages in daycare along with non-pecuniary benefits of childcare use that are omitted by the benchmark estimator. Structural estimates suggest that the benefits of the policy are about twice as large than in the benchmark, mostly because increased access is valuable for parents. In line with these findings, counterfactual simulations suggest that parents are willing to pay substantially more for an increase in coverage than a reduction in price.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; margin-top: 0.8em"><u>Abstract</u>: Using a stringent large-scale policy intervention that capped rental prices in more than 60 municipalities in Catalonia, Spain, we find that rent control initially reduces average rents, but this effect vanishes after one year due to a 14%-18% decline in rental housing supply. House sales increase by 26%-38% while house prices increase by 3.3%-4.4%. The reduction in both rental and house prices stems from effects at the bottom of the respective distributions, with no significant effects on rents at the top. Conversely, expensive houses experience significant price increases. We estimate that working class properties lost 1 billion euros in value as a consequence of rent control, a significant larger amount than the 8 million euros gains from reduced rents for low- and medium-income tenants. Inequality also widened because house values at the top quartile of the distribution increased by almost 1.1 billion euros.</p>
